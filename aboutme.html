        <h1>RilyRobo – 3D Artist & Animator</h1>
        <p>From eerie circus themes to dark fantasy and horror, my work blends the macabre with the cartoonish, crafting characters and worlds that unsettle and captivate. My artistic journey started in middle school when a Blender class introduced me to 3D modeling. The first thing I ever made? A crude, blocky shotgun. It wasn't much, but it was the spark that set everything in motion.</p>
        
        <p>Inspired by early CGI like <em>ReBoot</em>, <em>Beast Wars</em>, and <em>Bionicle</em>, I found my passion for digital creation. Since then, I've specialized in <strong>character modeling, prop design, and rigging</strong>, working with indie studios, small teams, and commissions. I thrive on breathing life into static models, giving them movement, weight, and emotion—whether for games, animation, or VR.</p>
        
        <p>Some of my work includes rigging characters and props for <strong>VR Arcadia’s CRITICAL MASS EPISODE I</strong> (2021-2023), along with various projects under NDA. I also develop tools to streamline rigging processes, such as my automation for facial viseme setup in VRChat.</p>
        
        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
        <p>I want my work to make people feel—whether it's awe, fear, excitement, or sorrow. I want you to love a character, only to have your heart torn out when they meet a tragic end. My storytelling leans into moral quandaries and nihilistic twists, setting expectations before shattering them in ways that leave a lasting impact.</p>
        
        <h2>My Workflow</h2>
        <p>Every project follows a structured yet flexible approach: <strong>Sketch → Blockout → Detailed Model → UV → Texturing → Rigging</strong>. I provide regular updates with progress shots—and sometimes, a laugh from the funny quirks that come up during development.</p>
        
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>My dream is to create an open-world RPG where players customize robotic characters scavenged from the world around them. In the long run, I aim to establish my own studio, producing original stories with motion capture and automation—bringing my ever-growing 'Red Book of Ideas' to life.</p>
