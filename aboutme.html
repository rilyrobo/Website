        <h1>RilyRobo – 3D Artist & Technical Animator</h1>
        <p>A creepy, circus-themed, macabre, dark fantasy, cartoonish, horror-inspired artist.</p>
        
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My journey into 3D art began in middle school when I was introduced to Blender. My first project? A crude, single-shot shotgun—blocky, sharp, and simple, but it sparked a passion that never faded. I grew up fascinated by early CGI like <em>ReBoot</em>, <em>Beast Wars</em>, and the <em>Bionicle</em> movies, which fueled my love for surreal, eerie, and stylized visuals.</p>
        
        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I specialize in character modeling, prop design, and rigging, helping bring digital creations to life for games, animation, and VR experiences. I’ve worked with indie studios, small teams, and commissions, always aiming to create immersive and emotionally impactful designs.</p>
        
        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <strong>VR Arcadia’s CRITICAL MASS EPISODE I (2021-2023)</strong> – Technical Animator, responsible for rigging, placeholder animations, and background asset animation.<br>
        <strong>Whack-A-Jack</strong> – A solo arcade-style game that gained positive reception for its engaging mechanics.<br>
        <strong>VRChat Retro Game Recreation</strong> – Developing immersive retro arcade experiences for VRChat.<br>
        Additional projects under NDA.<br>
        
        <h2>Creative Philosophy</h2>
        <p>I want my work to make you <strong>feel</strong>—whether it’s awe, fear, excitement, or sorrow. I want you to connect with a character, only to have your heart torn out when their story takes a tragic turn. I explore moral quandaries, nihilistic themes, and dark humor to create unforgettable experiences.</p>
        
        <h2>Skills & Tools</h2>
        <strong>3D Modeling & Rigging:</strong> Blender (primary), Maya (as needed)<br>
        <strong>Game Engines:</strong> GameMaker 8, Unity, Unreal Engine 4 (basic)<br>
        <strong>Animation & Texturing:</strong> Bringing characters, props, and environments to life<br>
        <strong>Technical Work:</strong> Motion capture integration, automated rigging tools<br>
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>My dream is to create an open-world RPG where players customize robotic characters scavenged from the world around them, battling an environment that slowly erodes them. Long-term, I aim to establish my own studio, producing original animations and games using motion capture and automation to bring my growing 'Red Book of Ideas' to life.</p>
